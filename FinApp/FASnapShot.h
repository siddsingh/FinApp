// Create and/or return the single shared data store
+ (FASnapShot *) sharedSnapShot;

// Returns if that event is a High Impact event or not. Examples of high impact events: 1) High impact product launches like iPhone 8, Naples Chip as these either validate my investment thesis or help form a new one. 2) High impact econ events that help shed light on how the market is likely to play out. e.g. Interest rates are likely to go up. Financials will do well. GDP is a big number stocks will likely do well.3) Big name companies earnings like FANG or Apple whose earnings can impact overall market.
